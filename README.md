# pyjust

NOTE: I've moved management of this to https://github.com/justin-yan/pybin, which gives me a single place to manage multiple such distributions.

This is a simple wrapper around `just` (https://github.com/casey/just) that enables it to be distributed via `pip`.

This repo is a template rendered from [pybin](https://github.com/justin-yan/templates-cruft/tree/main/packages-public/pybin), which explains at a high level how this packaging works.
